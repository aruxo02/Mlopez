# Hello World & Welcome to My Digital Corner! 👋💻

Come on in! Don't be shy. This is the repository where the code for my **Personal Portfolio / Presentation Website** lives. Yep, that shiny place ✨ on the internet where I try to convince the world (and myself) that I know how to write code.

## Who's Behind the Keyboard? ⌨️🤔

I'm **Moisés López Otero**, a wandering knight of programming. For 8 glorious years, I fought dragons 🐉 and bugs 🐞 in the lands of **.NET (C#, Xamarin, MAUI... I know them well!)**.

But like any good adventurer, I seek new horizons! 🧭 Now I'm on an exciting quest: mastering the mystical art of **Python** 🐍 and venturing into the jungle of **Artificial Intelligence** 🤖🧠. Wish me luck! (I'll need it 😅).

When I'm not deciphering code or talking to my rubber duck 🦆, you'll probably find me:

*   Meditating by a lake 🏞️ (or just skipping stones).
*   Trying to conquer a mountain 🏔️ (or catching my breath halfway up).
*   Learning Polish in Kraków 🇵🇱 (Trzymaj kciuki!🤞 - *Keep your fingers crossed!*).

## What Tech Powers This Marvel? 🚀

This site is built with:

*   A whole lot of semantic `HTML` (or so I try!).
*   A generous pinch of `CSS` to make it look pretty ✨.
*   A dose of `JavaScript` for those interactive sparks 🪄.

*(There might be some frameworks/libraries involved... or maybe just black magic and duct tape 🧙‍♂️🩹).*

## Dare to Explore? 👀

Inside the website you'll find:

*   **Projects:** The (more or less) irrefutable proof that I've built stuff. From .NET relics to my steps in Python/AI .
*   **Skills:** My arsenal of tech tools. Look how they shine! ⚔️🛡️
*   **Contact:** Want to chat? Offer me my dream AI job with a mountain view? 😉 Go ahead!
